> A simple and modern langing page that serves my client as business card.

## Introduction
This project was completely created by me. First I was designed a website template and created ux/ui in Figma (+ edited project images is Photoshop). After I did front-end part and litle bit of back-end in Visual Studio Code. In the final I upload project to the hosting and make some corrections which client told me to do. Thats it!

## How it was made
This is a list of technologies that I used in this project
* HTML + CSS (I use preprocessor SCSS) - There is nothing to describe here. Just coding. 
* JavaScript - With JS I made cool interaction with header and mobile menu (hamburger).
* PHP - To be honest, I dont know PHP. But I spend couple of hours to understand, how to send email from contact form using PHP and I was made it.

## Status
The project is completely ready. The client was satisfied with my job.
