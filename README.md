# Bitcoin konzultace
> A simple, modern and responsive langing page that serves my client as business card. Here it is - https://www.bitcoinkonzultace.cz/

## Introduction
This project was completely created by myself. First I was designed a website template and created UX/UI in Figma (+ edited project images in Photoshop). After I did front-end part and litle bit of back-end in Visual Studio Code. As a result, I uploaded the entire project to the hosting via FTP to the hosting and presented result to the client. Thats it!

## How it was made
This is a list of technologies that I used in this project
* HTML + CSS (I use preprocessor SCSS) - There is nothing to describe here. Just coding. 
* JavaScript - With JS I made cool interaction with header and mobile menu (hamburger).
* PHP - To be honest, I dont know PHP. But I spend couple of hours to understand, how to send emails from contact form using PHP and as a result, I was made mail.php file.

## Status
The project is completely ready. The client was satisfied with my job.
